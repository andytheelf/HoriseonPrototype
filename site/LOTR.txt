    <hr/>
   <p>Born January 3<sup>rd</sup> 1892 in Bloemfontein (now Free State Province) South Africa to mother Mabel Tolkien and Arthur Reuel
    Tolkien. At the age of 3 his mother took him and his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien, to England to visit family. However
    while in England his father died of rheumatic fever, turning what was supposed to be an extended visit into a permanant move. Tolkien
    met his future wife Edith when he was 16. Coming from similar backgrounds and being of similar dispositions they quickly fell in love.
    However, Tolkien's guardian did not approve of the two, and forbade Tolkien from seeing her until he turned 21. Tolkien obeyed,
    and on the eve of his 21<sup>st</sup> birthday wrote to Edith asking her to marry him. She accepted his proposal, and broke off her 
    other engagement.

    In 1914 Britain entered <abbr title="World War II">WWII.</abbr> Tolkien endured much criticism from his family for finishing school 
     before enlisting. But from 1915 to 1920 he fought in France. Reurning to England after the war Tolkien took up a teaching position at
     The University of Leeds. That was the beginning of career as a professor, and his journey towards creating foundation of fantasy
     literature as we know it today.</p>
